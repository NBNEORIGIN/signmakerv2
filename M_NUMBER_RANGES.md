# M-Number Allocation

To avoid conflicts, each staff member should use their assigned M-number range.

## Assigned Ranges

| Staff Member | M-Number Range | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| Toby | M1000 - M1499 | Admin + main range |
| Gabby | M1500 - M1999 | |
| Sanna | M2000 - M2499 | |
| Jo | M2500 - M2999 | |

## Rules

1. **Stay within your range** - Don't use M-numbers outside your allocation
2. **Use sequential numbers** - Start from the beginning of your range
3. **Track your last used number** - Note it down to avoid gaps
4. **Request more range** - If you run out, ask Toby for an extension

## Example

If you're Gabby (range M1500-M1999):
- First batch: M1500, M1501, M1502...
- Second batch: Continue from where you left off
